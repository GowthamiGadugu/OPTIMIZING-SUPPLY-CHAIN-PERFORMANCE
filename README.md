OPTIMIZING SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE:     PREDICTING LATE DELIVERIES AND SEGMENT RISK

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s global marketplace, supply chains face increasing pressure to deliver goods faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors. Delays in delivery not only disrupt operations but also erode customer trust and profitability. Addressing this challenge requires a data-driven approach to identify the root causes of delays and segment customers based on risk and value.

Our project focuses on leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning to enhance supply chain performance. By analyzing historical order data and implementing machine learning models, we aim to predict late deliveries and categorize customers according to their delivery risk and profitability.

## Research Questions

1. What are the most significant drivers of late deliveries in supply chains?

   Identifying operational inefficiencies that lead to delays.

   Analyzing factors such as delivery status, shipping mode, and customer characteristics.

2. How can customers be segmented by delivery risk and profitability?

   Using clustering techniques to group customers based on delivery performance and revenue impact.

   Understanding the correlation between late delivery risk and customer value.

## Methodology Highlights
Data Source: DataCo Supply Chain Dataset
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Key Predictors: Delivery Status, Shipping Mode, On-time Shipping
Techniques: Rule-based logic and K-Means clustering
Customer Labels: Low, Medium, and High Risk
Feature Engineering: Aggregating features such as average late risk, total sales, and benefit

## Key Insights

*Predictive Modeling:*
Delivery status and shipping mode are the primary predictors of delays.
Financial factors, such as sales per customer, have minimal impact on delivery risk.

*Customer Risk Segmentation:*
High-risk customers often coincide with high revenue, emphasizing the need for strategic prioritization.
Clustering revealed three balanced groups, allowing targeted risk mitigation strategies.

*Strategic Implications:*
Proactively managing high-risk, high-value customers can reduce delays and enhance customer satisfaction.
Integrating predictive insights into logistics decision-making can significantly minimize operational disruptions.
